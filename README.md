# EnvStation

A lightweight tool to create reproducible development environments on immutable Linux distributions (Bazzite / Fedora / Arch — and more).

## Introduction

EnvStation is a desktop app that helps you keep development environments in sync on immutable Linux systems. It uses a small Rust backend and a React/Tauri frontend to manage Distrobox and DevContainer setups. A single manifest keeps the host container environment and the IDE container aligned while respecting the constraints of a read-only root filesystem.

For a technical deep dive, see ARCHITECTURE.md.

## Why EnvStation?

Traditional development workflows often break on **immutable distributions** (like Bazzite, Fedora Silverblue, or SteamOS). EnvStation fixes this by acting as the intelligent bridge between your host terminal and your IDE.

### 1. Unified Environment Parity
On immutable systems, your host is read-only. Usually, your dependencies are trapped inside a DevContainer, leaving your native host terminal (Ptyxis, Alacritty) "dumb."
* **The Solution:** EnvStation mirrors your environment across **Distrobox** (for your native terminal) and **DevContainers** (for your IDE).
* **The Result:** Run `gcc`, `python`, or `git` anywhere—inside or outside of VS Code—without configuring it twice.

### 2. Intelligent Drift Detection
Manual changes in the terminal are inevitable—but they often lead to "snowflake" environments that are impossible to reproduce. EnvStation keeps you in control:
* **Smart Baseline:** Instead of cluttering your view with hundreds of pre-installed system packages, EnvStation snapshots the environment the moment it's created. This ensures you only see the packages *you* actually added.
* **No More Guesswork:** The app detects when your container, your VS Code setup, and your configuration file fall out of sync.
* **One-Click Sync:** If things "drift" apart, EnvStation offers a simple fix: a single click to bring all layers back into perfect alignment.

**The Result:** Your environments stay clean, slim, and—most importantly—reproducible, no matter how much you experiment in the terminal.

### 3. Abstracting the Complexity
You shouldn't need a PhD in Container-Orchestration just to write "Hello World."
* **No Terminal Acrobatics:** Manage Podman and Distrobox through a clean GUI. No more memorizing cryptic flags or complex volume mount syntax.
* **Safe Defaults:** Automatically handles tricky technical hurdles like **Podman GraphRoot relocation**—a common point of failure on immutable systems.
* **Ready in under 2 Minutes:** Choose from pre-configured templates (Python, Rust, C++, etc.) and go from zero to "ready-to-code" in three clicks.

> **EnvStation is the Control Center for your development flow.** It combines the isolation of containers with the comfort of a native OS, ensuring your manifest remains the single source of truth.

## Key Technical Features

- Rust backend: fast and memory-safe code for background tasks.
- Rootless operation: uses user-level Podman/Distrobox so no root access is required.
- Single manifest: one .envstation.json controls synchronization between host Distrobox and DevContainer.
- Bidirectional Drift Detection: machine-readable, baseline-driven detection keeps the Distrobox container, the VS Code `devcontainer.json`, and the central manifest in sync; UI surfaces a fallback warning if a conservative query fallback is used.
- Storage helpers: tools to move Podman user storage to another location to save space on constrained disks.

---

## Supported Environments

EnvStation provides scaffolding and DevContainer sync for these ecosystems:

- Python (data science, AI, scripting)
- Node / React (frontend & fullstack)
- Rust (systems)
- Java (backend)
- C / C++ (native & embedded)
- C# (.NET, backend & desktop)

Each environment includes a starter manifest and suggested VS Code extensions. 

---

## Comparison

| Concern | Manual Distrobox / DevContainer Setup | EnvStation |
|---|---:|---|
| Repeatable setup | ad-hoc scripts and manual edits | declarative manifest + scaffolding |
| Security model | varies by setup | rootless Podman with controlled mounts |
| Drift handling | manual reconciliation | manifest-driven sync |
| Disk management | manual moves | guided storage relocation |

---

## Roadmap

- ✅ MVP (done): environment creation, manifest-based sync, storage relocation
- ✅ Drift detection and adoption flows (implemented)
- 🔜 In progress: transactional rollback for sync operations

## Motivation: From "Nightmare Setup" to Native Flow

EnvStation was born out of real-world friction. 

Coming from a Frontend background (React/TS), I faced a major hurdle when moving my AI research - local training of OpenCV and ResNet models - to **Bazzite**. In a prior project (Goldgrube Coin Tool) I relied on ResNet models and local toolchains; you can find that repository [here](https://github.com/Kubaguette/goldgrube-coin-tool). As an immutable distribution, the "Windows way" or even the "standard Linux way" of installing toolchains simply didn't work.

I found myself trapped in a **"Nightmare Setup"**:
- ❌ Traditional terminal Python installs failed on the read-only root.
- ❌ Fragmented Conda environments that didn't talk to VS Code properly.
- ❌ High barrier to entry for students and engineers new to immutable OSs.

**The Mission:**
I built this tool to ensure that no developer has to waste hours on environment plumbing again. EnvStation bridges the gap, providing a frictionless, native-feeling UI to manage what used to be a complex, manual process.

## Quick Start & Requirements

These steps are intentionally concise. Expand them to match your environment and distribution.

### Prerequisites (common)
- An immutable Linux host (Bazzite / Kinoite / Fedora Silverblue / SteamOS, etc.)
- Podman (rootless) available on the host
- Distrobox installed for comfortable host-container integration
- Node >= 18 and npm or pnpm (for frontend development)
- Rust (stable) + cargo (for backend build)

Verify Podman and Distrobox are available:
```bash
podman --version
distrobox --version
podman info   # ensures Podman can run for your user
# If you use the Podman API/socket with other tools, enable it:
systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
```

---

### Installation (End-User)

Recommended (No‑Reboot) Way — AppImage
--------------------------------------
For immutable hosts (Bazzite, Fedora Silverblue, Kinoite, SteamOS), the AppImage is the recommended distribution because it requires no system changes or reboot. It provides the smoothest experience for users who cannot or prefer not to modify the OSTree system image.

#### AppImage (Recommended)
AppImage runs on most distributions without installation:
```bash
chmod +x EnvStation-1.0.0.AppImage
./EnvStation-1.0.0.AppImage
```
AppImages are portable and convenient but usually larger (they bundle runtimes). Use this if you want to avoid modifying the immutable host or rebooting.

---

Other install options
---------------------
EnvStation is also distributed as native packages (.deb and .rpm). Choose the option that fits your distro and policy.

#### Debian / Ubuntu (.deb)
```bash
# Newer apt supports local .deb install:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install ./EnvStation_1.0.0_amd64.deb

# Or with dpkg + fix dependencies:
sudo dpkg -i EnvStation_1.0.0_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get install -f
```

#### Fedora / RHEL Immutable Hosts (Silverblue / Bazzite / Kinoite)
On OSTree-based immutable systems you cannot use `sudo dnf` to install host packages. Use rpm-ostree and reboot to apply the deployment:
```bash
# Install to the immutable OSTree deployment (example):
sudo rpm-ostree install ./EnvStation-1.0.0.x86_64.rpm
# A system reboot is required to apply the new deployment
sudo systemctl reboot
```
Notes:
- rpm-ostree performs an atomic OSTree deployment. The package is staged and becomes active after reboot.
- If you prefer not to reboot or modify the host image, use the AppImage instead.

#### Fedora / RHEL (traditional, mutable systems)
If you are on a mutable Fedora/RHEL workstation (not OSTree-based), you can install with dnf:
```bash
sudo dnf install ./EnvStation-1.0.0.x86_64.rpm
```

#### Arch Linux (pkg.tar.zst or AUR)
Arch users typically install using a package in pacman format or from the AUR if available:
```bash
# If you have a built pacman package:
sudo pacman -U ./envstation-1.0.0-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.zst

# Or install from AUR using an AUR helper (if package published):
paru -S envstation   # or yay -S envstation
```
If no Arch package is available, prefer the AppImage or build from source.

#### Notes:
- Make sure Podman and Distrobox are installed and working before running EnvStation. EnvStation expects rootless Podman for normal operation.
- On OSTree-based systems (Silverblue / Bazzite / Kinoite) prefer the AppImage or use rpm-ostree and reboot to install host packages.
- For RHEL / CentOS you may prefer to use EPEL or the distro's packaging tools to get Podman and its dependencies.

---

### Installing Podman & Distrobox (examples, skip if installed)

#### Fedora / RHEL:
```bash
sudo dnf install -y podman distrobox
systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
```

#### Ubuntu / Debian (example: 22.04+):
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y podman distrobox
# If distrobox isn't available on your Ubuntu version, see:
# https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox or the upstream distrobox README
```

#### Arch:
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu podman distrobox
systemctl --user enable --now podman.socket
```

If a distribution does not ship distrobox or a recent Podman, follow the official upstream instructions:
- Podman: https://podman.io/getting-started/installation
- Distrobox: https://github.com/89luca89/distrobox

---

### Installation (developer mode)

Development should run inside a mutable container (distrobox/toolbox) because the host OS is immutable. Example:

```bash
# create or enter a mutable development container
# distrobox create --name devbox --image registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora-toolbox:latest --yes
distrobox enter devbox
```

1. Clone and install JS deps
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kubaguette/envstation.git
cd envstation
npm install
```

2. Install native dev dependencies (common packages vary by distro)

#### Fedora / Bazzite / Kinoite (dnf)
```bash
sudo dnf install -y webkit2gtk4.1-devel libappindicator-gtk3-devel librsvg2-devel gtk3-devel gcc gcc-c++ make xdg-utils fuse
```

#### Ubuntu / Debian (apt)
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y libwebkit2gtk-4.0-dev libappindicator3-dev librsvg2-dev libgtk-3-dev build-essential xdg-utils fuse
# package names can vary by Ubuntu version; if a package is missing, search with apt-cache search
```

#### Arch (pacman)
```bash
sudo pacman -Syu webkit2gtk libappindicator-gtk3 librsvg gtk3 base-devel xdg-utils fuse
# Arch package names may differ slightly; use pacman -Ss to confirm exact names
```

3. Start the unified dev workflow
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```

Notes:
- `npm run tauri dev` compiles the Rust backend and starts the Vite dev server together. You may need PKG_CONFIG and other env vars for WebKit bindings.
- If you run into missing headers or pkg-config errors, double-check the dev packages above for your distro and install pkg-config if required.
